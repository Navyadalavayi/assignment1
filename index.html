    <p>The Squid Game game's origins come from a traditional Korean game similar in many ways to the popular 1990s game known as Pogs. The goal is simply to flip your opponent's tile on the ground by striking it with your own tile, made of folded paper.<br> story of people who fail at life for various reasons, but suddenly receive a mysterious invitation to participate in a survival game to win more than 38 million US dollars. The game takes place on an isolated island and the participants are locked up until there is a final winner.<br>
        Its satire of capitalism isn't exactly subtle, and while it may echo <i>real-life desperation across the world</i>, it's (thankfully) not inspired by any actual murderous games – that we know of, anyway. Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, creator Hwang Dong-hyuk explained the show's origins. 
        <mark>the main message of Squid Game:-</mark>Squid Game is about capitalism. It is not a quirk that one character is from North Korea, and another character's entire backstory is that he was part of a strike that got busted.
        Squid Game tells the story of people who are struggling with financial issues due to poor choices in life. Spending wisely simply means having the knowledge and confidence to make the most of your money. No matter how big or small your income is, not overspending is a critical habit to get into.<br>In the fictional 2021 “Squid Game,” created by Hwang Dong-hyuk and inspired by his own struggles under capitalism in South Korea, contestants went through much worse, facing off in games with lethal consequences, such as falling to your death or getting shot.</p>
